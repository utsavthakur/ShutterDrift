{  Build the Cinematic Scroll Engine 
CRITICAL FIRST STEP: Asset Discovery

Research the public folder: Use your file system tools to search for image sequences (e.g., folders full of .jpg or .png files with sequential naming like frame-001).
Analyze Frame Details: Determine the FRAME_COUNT, the specific SUBFOLDER_PATH, and the NAMING_CONVENTION (e.g., zero-padding length).
Identify Theme: Look at globals.css or existing components to determine a suitable ACCENT_COLOR and theme (Dark/Light).
Objective: Once assets are found, implement a high-performance, canvas-based scroll animation component.

1. Configuration & Performance:

Dynamic frame sequence: Create a configuration object based on your findings from the discovery step.
Progressive Loader: Implement a 3-stage loading logic to ensure the page is interactive within seconds:
Stage 1: Load the first frame immediately.
Stage 2: Load every 3rd or 4th frame (low-fps interaction ready).
Stage 3: Load the full sequence in chunks with a minor delay between chunks to keep the main thread free.
Memory Management: Use HTMLCanvasElement for rendering instead of thousands of <img> tags.
2. Premium Motion Physics:

Global Smoothness: Integrate a smooth-scrollbar (like Lenis) with a lerp of 0.05 to 0.1 for a fluid global feel.
Local Interpolation: Use Framer Motion’s useSpring (stiffness: 80-120, damping: 25-35) to smooth out the frame switching logic. The scroll should feel "heavy" and premium, not jittery.
3. Environmental "Glue" (Aesthetics):

Filmic Overlays: Implement a persistent SVG feTurbulence noise filter at very low opacity (0.02-0.05) to add texture.
Dynamic Lighting: Add a radial vignette and ambient background glows (pulsing slowly) that follow the scroll or mouse position.
Cinematic Reveal: Use a "Cinematic Loader" UI that shows a percentage and opens like a camera shutter once the first critical frames are ready.
4. Scrollytelling Architecture:

Create a h-[800vh] (or higher) container to provide enough "room" for the video sequence to breathe.
Map the scrollYProgress to various properties:
Frame Index: Interp from 0 to FRAME_COUNT - 1.
Opacity/Scale: Use useTransform to fade in/out text overlays at specific milestones.
Use sticky positioning for the canvas so it stays fixed in the viewport.
Final Polish: Ensure all interactive elements have hover effects that react to the identified theme and include micro-animations like particle bursts or shifting gradients.  }
